<p>
At this moment, this is my hobby-project to build a simple but functional OS.
It is build in assembly language.
</p></br>
<p>
Make an Operating System is VERY hard. You MUST learn a lot of information
about it before you can start write a simple line of code. </p><br>

<p>
An Operarting System is VERY complex and need a lot of things that I don't
know (at this moment) how to build (FileSystems, installation on hard disk,
making GUIs, and more, much more!). Yeah, the command line is an ancient tool
that MANY MANY users don't like use it (I don't have any problem with that :P),
but it is the simple way to start in OS development.
</p><br>
<p>
So, if anyone start saying to me: "You MUST do a graphical thing like in
window$! The command line sucks!", I'll answer: "You, f**ing bastard, go on
and build your f**ing OS".
</p>
<p>
I really enjoy doing this and I will hope that you, my dear advanced-skill
user, will enjoy reading my code and testing my little progress!
