INSTALLATION
============

UNIX/LINUX
----------
Required packages:
	GNU build tools (gcc, make, etc.)
	NASM assembler
	genisoimage
	

The build process will need root privileges because 'requish.bash' must download
'syslinux' package under /opt directory. The ISO creation process will be on /tmp
directory (you can delete '/tmp/'  contents for each re-build, but it is not
necessary).

So, execute as root:
	make do-all do-iso
	
	to build sources and create the ISO file under /tmp directory.

	You can burn the ISO onto CD/DVD disc or test it on VirtualBox/Qemu/VMware
	virtualization software :)


If you want see others building options, run:
	make
	or
	make help (but typing make is shorter ;) )
