???????????:
	* Create BUILD-INSTALL file.
	* Change 'clean' text in Makefile option.
	* Comented code on com/help/help.asm for avoid errors on 
	  incl/com/help.inc. The HELP program is not programmed yet. :(
	* Now, all directories/files created wit 'make' will store on
	  'out' directory, instead of /tmp. More easy for cross-platform.

???????????:
	* Created the how-to *ASSEMBLY* file which is a full-resumed-resource
	  about assembly language for 16, 32 and 64 bits.
	* Fixing small bugs in *Makefile* and *requish.bash* files.
	* Create tree directory for OS commands. 
	  · Each command have his directory, with his source file and his 
	    Makefile.
	  · Each command his a binary file that MUST store on OS directory
	    structure (root-directory). But, I don't know how achieve this now
	    (I need programming the file-system first)

0.0.2pre-alpha:
	* User input fixed up 64 characteres.
	* Small command parsing (up 4 commands, but only 2 works)
	* Reboot and shutdown may be a VERY difficult achieve by lack of
	  APM support on new BIOS. But I will study this :)
	  The only way to reboot (if you tested on Live CD) is press:
	  CTRL-ALT-DEL (CTRL-ALT-SUPR in Spanish keyboard)
